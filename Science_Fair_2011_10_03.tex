\section{Partial DNA}

\subsection*{Description}
Given a long sequence of DNA as a string, output the first 10 chars followed by three dots followed by the last 10 chars. 

\subsection*{Note}
We are using a file input (use FILE, fopen, fscanf) and the standard console output (printf).

\subsection*{Input Format}
You are given a string whose length is at least 20 bytes long, consisting only of A, C, G, and T.

\subsection*{Output Format}
Output as described.

\subsection*{Sample Input (input.txt)}
\begin{verbatim}
ACACAGGGTTAAAAATTTCG
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Sample Output}
\begin{verbatim}
ACACAGGGTT...AAAAATTTCG
\end{verbatim}

\section{Random Mutation}

\subsection*{Description}
You are given two long sequences of DNAs as two strings.  The two strings are called $A$ and $B$ for convenience, and their length is equal, being $n$.
You are going to mutate them at random as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pick a number $l$ at random which specifies the length of substrings being mutated - note that $l$ should be between $1$ and $n$
  \item Pick a number $a$ at random, at which the mutation starts in string $A$ - note that $a$ should be between $0$ and $n - l$
  \item Pick a number $b$ at random, at which the mutation starts in string $B$ - note that $a$ should be between $0$ and $n - l$
  \item Finally, you are going to mutate $A$ and $B$ to get a new string $A'$ and $B'$ by swapping the substring $A[a .. (a+l-1)]$ and $B[b .. (b+l-1)]$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Note}
We are using a file input (use FILE, fopen, fscanf) and the standard console output (printf).

\subsection*{Input Format}
You are given two strings whose length is equal and at least 20 bytes long, consisting only of A, C, G, and T.

\subsection*{Sample Input (input.txt)}
\begin{verbatim}
ACACAGGGTTAAAAATTTCG
TAGACAGTACTGACTAATGC
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Sample Output}
\begin{verbatim}
A: ACACAGGGTTAAAAATTTCG
B: TAGACAGTACTGACTAATGC
Random numbers: l = 4, a = 0, b = 10
    01234567890123456789
A': TGACAGGGTTAAAAATTTCG
B': TAGACAGTACACACTAATGC
